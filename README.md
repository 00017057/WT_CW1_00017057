## Aim

Aim of this particular project is to show alternative representation of a web site for a local IT school called 'PROWEB'. Basically, it provides some of the most necessary information that any organization's web-site should have.

## Structure

Project is entirely built on plain **HTML** and **CSS** only, without using any frameworks. During development process all the up-to date HTML5 semantic tags and CSS3 were used in order to improve accessibility and overall styling. Web-site contains 6 main, different from each other, pages that are located in 'html' folder (except the 'home' page). These include:

1. [home](index.html)
2. [about](html/about.html)
3. [services](html/services.html)
4. [courses](html/courses.html)
5. [career](html/career.html)
6. [contacts](html/contacts.html)

Additionally, there is one file for styling called 'style.css' that is located in [css](/css/style.css) folder.

All of the images used on a site can be accessed through [img](img/) folder.

## How to use

Open up index.html (or any other .html file from 'html' folder) via browser (chrome, edge, etc.) and now you run the site. You can navigate to different pages through 'nav' bar at the top of each page or via other links provided on some of the pages.
